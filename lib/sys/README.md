# nusion-sys
The system abstraction layer backend crate for nusion.

### Note
This crate should never be used directly.  Its purpose
is to provide a backend system abstraction layer for
nusion to improve portability.  Instead, the main
nusion crate should be used to provide more advanced,
high-level, and safe(r) abstractions.
