# nusion-core-sys
The system abstraction layer backend crate for nusion-core.

### Note
This crate should never be used directly.  Its purpose
is to provide a backend system abstraction layer for
nusion-core to provide cross-platform support. Instead,
nusion-core should be used to provide more advanced,
high-level, and safe(r) abstractions.
