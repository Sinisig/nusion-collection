     --- Before leaving alpha phase ---

 * Perform a general code review.  There
   is a lot of unsafe{} in here!  Especially
   the OS abstractions...those are the worst
   offenders.  I would be VERY suprised if
   there isn't at least one memory safety
   bug or stupid mistake causing UB.

 * Proper massaging of OS error codes into
   Rust error enums.  Currently, no actual
   errors are returned, only "Unknown"
   variants

 * Add support for at least 32-bit x86 and
   Linux (64 and 32 bit) in the sys crate.
   We don't want to restrict ourselves to
   only 64-bit Windows.  We're better than that!

 * Clean up process file to use hashmaps which
   reference strings contained inside a vector.
   This will partially solve the issue of
   referencing data moved inside the hash map
   so we can return string slices instead of
   making String copies (slow and bad)

 * Documentation! Clean up, review, and improve
   existing documentation and add new documentation.
   Most importantly, we need examples! Create sample
   code in the nusion crate root (lib.rs) showing
   how to define an entrypoint in a shared library
   and patch code.

 * Change nusion-lib Console to be a trait and
   implement the current Console struct on it
   and rename the struct to something like "OSConsole"
   or "DebugConsole" or something like that.

 * Edit the main executor functions to print an
   error log similar to the panic log when main
   return an error code
