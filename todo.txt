     --- Before leaving alpha phase ---

 * Proper massaging of OS error codes into
   Rust error enums.  Currently, no actual
   errors are returned, only "Unknown"
   variants

 * Add support for at least 32-bit x86 and
   Linux (64 and 32 bit) in the sys crate.
   We don't want to restrict ourselves to
   only 64-bit Windows.  We're better than that!

 * Clean up process file to use hashmaps which
   reference strings contained inside a vector.
   This is tricky because of lifetime bullshit
   complaining about "moved" data (that's not
   really moved)

 * Change nusion-lib Console to be a trait and
   implement the current Console struct on it
   and rename the struct to something like "OSConsole"
   or "DebugConsole" or something like that.

 * Improve error messaging in the panic handler
